AllContactListAactivty is the first activity which has two tabs. one is allContacts and another is starredContacts .in first tab you will have all the contacts .and in second one you will have fav contacts.and I have used Shimmer for making it good look wise as we have seen like in Facebook and youtube.shimmer will be there until the we get result. 
 
2.on click over individual contact there is a activity detail which has all the details of user (not all the detail but number and email(if there is email),name) . i am showing two numbers there for now and the type of number is also there and you can make a dail from there after long clicking on first number(not the second one).
